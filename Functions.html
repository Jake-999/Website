            <h1>What is a function in c++?</h1>
            <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</p>
            <br>

            <h1>Creating a function</h1>
            <br>
            <p>C++ provides some pre-defined functions, such as main(), which is used to execute code. But you can also create your own functions to perform certain actions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To create (often referred to as declare) a function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses () a then ollowed by curly brackets {};</p>
            <br>
            
            <section id="IDE">
                <p>void Main () {</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>// some code</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>}</p>
                </section>
                <p>There are two types of main data_types in functions one being void and the other being int but you are also able to use other data_types but these are not relavant.</p>
                <p>Void - The void data_type means that when the function finishes the data will not be returned or stored outside of the function.</p>
                <p>Int - The int data_type means that the data used in the function has a data return and also using int means that you are able to acceess the data from a different function.</p>
                <br>
                <p>All of the code written iside of the curly brackets will be run once the function has been called, also the data stored inside of the function can be trasfered between functions but only if the data_type is not void as void means that there is no return value.</p>
