        <h1>Basics of c++ programming</h1>
        <p>In this page we are going to learn the basics of a c++ page and the basic syntax.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What is a syntax?</p>
        <p>When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what a class, object, methods, and instant variables mean.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.</p></li>
            <li><p>Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.</p></li>
            <li><p>Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.</p></li>
            <li><p>Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <section id="IDE">
            <div class="code">
                <p>#include <iostream></p>
                    <p>using namespace std;</p>
                <p> // main() is where program execution begins.</p>
                <p>int main() { </p>
                    <p> cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World </p>
                    <p>return 0; </p>
                <p>}</p></div>
        </section>
        <section Class="Text">
            <p>The #include is importing the libary, and to make a c++ script needs to have iostream to be able to run the basics.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The using namespace std is a not a namespace that u need to run but t maks it easier when writing long lines of code as when you are in your IDE you will need to write std:: before you write the line of code.</p>
            <br>
            <p>the main function int is used as a data storing function you can also use void but this will put your data in the void so that it will not be able to get accessed, you are also abke to use static but this makes the data that is instiated in the main and that the data stored iside of the masin will not be able to be transferred to the next function.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The use of curly brackets "{}" is to declare when the function starts and finished.</p>
            <br>
            <p>in C++ there are two types of main operators "<<" and ">>" these are used to tell the computer which part of the line that it needs to read, for example using "<<" will say to the computer that the line after the "<<" needs to be processed, same for ">>" this shows that the line of code before the ">>" needs to be read.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The return function is just saying that after the code gets to the return line it will stop the code running.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After every line of code you will need to put a semi-colon ";" to tell the computer when your line of code is finished.</p>

            <h1>C++ Identifiers</h1>
      <p>A C++ identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).</p>
           <br>
        <p>C++ does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C++ is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C++.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers −</p>
                <br>
               <p>mohd</p>       <p>zara</p>    <p>abc</p>   <p>move_name</p>  <p>a_123</p>
               <p>myname50</p>  <p> _temp</p>  <p>j</p>    <p> a23b9</p>     <p>retVal</p>
